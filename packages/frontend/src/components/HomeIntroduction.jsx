        Before Greek authors wrote&nbsp;<i>The Pentateuch</i>&nbsp;(Greek: “<i>five books</i>”),
        they had produced other literary masterpieces known as the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;and
        the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero of the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;is
        Achilles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero of the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;is Odysseus.&nbsp;&nbsp;There
        were prophets and gods in both stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;Calchas and Aegyptius are examples of
        these prophets in the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;stories
        respectively. Zeus is the main god of both. Nearly 200 years later, Greek authors had become
        world-renowned for their writing and storytelling abilities.

        By 600 BCE, the Hebrew culture had not yet developed its language skills enough to properly
        write its own history—stories that had been passed down orally for many generations. In an
        effort to consolidate the various oral accounts of their history, Ancient Hebrew tribal
        leaders hired Greek authors to write the Hebrew&nbsp;<i>Torah</i>, which was originally
        called&nbsp;<i>The Pentateuch</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The main hero of Torah was
        Abraham.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hebrew god was&nbsp;<i>Elohim</i>, which (interpreted properly) is a
        plural form of a Hebrew term meaning “god.” Over the years following the publication
        of&nbsp;<i>The Pentaeuch</i>, Hebrew leaders used Greek authors and storytellers to
        elaborate and expound upon the Hebrew story.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>
          This is how the Old Testament of the Bible was created.&nbsp;

        Near the 4th Century C.E., Greek authors were once again called upon to create another
        story. This one dovetailed the Old Testament and incorporated other contemporary beliefs
        held by the masses who were living in the Great Roman Empire at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus,
        the New Testament was created.

        The Bible was first written in Greek, by Greek authors who were commissioned and hired to
        use their adroit writing and storytelling skills to tell a story.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible is a
        fictitious story.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its storyline and its characters are not any more real than its
        predecessors&#39;, those of the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;and of the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
        the Bible has been and is more widely read and accepted as&nbsp;<i>real</i>&nbsp;by more
        people than any other book on Earth.

        Throughout the years that the Bible has existed, unscrupulous individuals have used it for
        personal profit and to control the hearts and minds of billions of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone
        who has stood up to these religious leaders and called the Bible out for what it really is,
        was killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Later Greek authors witnessed how the Bible was being
        used.&nbsp;&nbsp;To counter how the story was being used, other Greek authors invented
        another Hebrew hero named Isaiah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempting to get their point across—that
        religion and the men who called themselves prophets and priests were corrupt—they created
        the book of Isaiah.

        The term&nbsp;<i>Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>® was taken from the book of Isaiah:

          “Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me,
          but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the
          precept of men: Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this
          people, even a&nbsp;
          <b>
            <i>marvellous work and a wonder</i>
          </b>: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their
          prudent men shall be hid.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 29:13–14)

        All religion is false.&nbsp;&nbsp;The three main religions that base their beliefs on the
        Bible (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) have triggered more human misery and strife than
        any other social causation known to humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous groups of individuals
        have always existed throughout history to counter the negative effects of
        religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have always used the religious beliefs in which the masses were
        indoctrinated to counter religion. They continue to do so today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        In the early 19th Century, in the newly formed United States of America, a group of these
        individuals laid the foundation for this modern&nbsp;<i>Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>®.
